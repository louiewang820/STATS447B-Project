# STATS447B-Project
##  Prediction on insurance claim of cars
* Image identification of damaged cars
* Prediction on claim of damaged cars 
# convolutional neural network
* A typical CNN has several convolution plus pooling layers and fully connected layers in the end 
* Each responsible for feature extraction at different levels of abstraction
* Filters in first layer detect horizental, vertical, and diagonal edges
* Filters in the next layer detect shapes
* Filters in the last layer detect collection of shapes
* Filter values randomly initialized, learned by learning algorithm
